Will you help us hand out food surpluses and by doing so prevent food waste.\n‚ÄúAn eye for food, a heart for people‚Äù\nNearly one million people in the Netherlands live below the poverty line. Did you know that this dire situation can be solved simply by giving food surpluses? A solution both good for people and the environment.\nEvery week our food bank volunteers hand out food to those who need it most. Companies, institutions, governments and individuals offer their support through funds, food, and services.\nThroughout the Netherlands, our volunteers show up with passion and dedication for their work in the food banks. Though we are tremendously grateful for the support and care of our sponsors, helping people in the food banks is very expensive. The funds are used for logistics, transportation and gasoline, and storage rent. For as little as $5 you can help a family eat for seven days.\nYour donation is solely for the people who need it most. No one in the food bank receives a salary. We only work with volunteers. Support the food bank with your donation.\nWill you join us too?",
